All manuscripts are to be submitted electronically to the ScholarOne
Abstracts site created for each conference. The manuscript upload will
be enabled several weeks after acceptance notices have been sent.
Presenting authors of accepted papers will receive an email with
instructions when manuscript submission opens. It is
#strike[important];#underline[#strong[important];] that presenting
authors keep their email addresses up-to-date so they do not miss this
notice.

= General Guidelines
The following section outlines general (nonformatting) guidelines to
follow. These guidelines are applicable to all authors (except as
noted), and include information on the policies and practices relevant
to the publication of your #strike[manuscript.];#underline[CHANGED.]

== Publication by AIAA
Your manuscript cannot be published by AIAA if:

+ It has been published previously or

+ #strike[The];#strike[ ];#strike[work];#strike[
  ];#strike[contains];#underline[Changed]
  #strike[copyright-infringing];#underline[for]
  #strike[material];#underline[something] #strike[or];#underline[new]

  ];#strike[has];#strike[ ];#strike[not];#strike[ ];#strike[yet];#strike[
  ];#strike[been];#strike[ ];#strike[selected.]

== Paper Review and Visa Considerations
It is the responsibility of the author to obtain any required government
or company reviews for their papers in advance of publication. Start
early to determine if the reviews are required; this process can take
several weeks.

If you plan to attend an AIAA Forum, technical conference or
professional development course held in the United States and you
require a visa for travel, it is incumbent upon you to apply for a visa
with the U.S. embassy (consular division) or consulate with ample time
for processing.#strike[ ];#strike[To];#strike[ ];#strike[avoid];#strike[

];#strike[anticipated];#strike[ ];#strike[travel.]

== Control ID Number vs Paper 
Your paper was assigned a control ID number at the time you submitted
your abstract. It is critical that you reference the tracking number and
conference name when contacting AIAA regarding your submission. The
control ID number is not the final AIAA paper number. The paper number,
which appears in the format AIAA-20XX-XXXX, will be used to refer to
your paper in the program and in any publication format. It will not be
assigned until shortly before the conference. #strong[Do not include a
paper number anywhere on your paper, as this number will be stamped
automatically in the top right corner of your paper at the time of
processing.]

== Copyright
Before AIAA can print or publish any paper, the copyright information
must be completed in the submission system. Failure to complete the
electronic form correctly could result in your paper not being
published. The following fields must be completed:

+ Clearance Statement

+ Non-Infringement Statement

+ Publication Status Statement
