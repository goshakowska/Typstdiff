= Introduction 
Authors using Microsoft Word will first need to save the AIAA Meeting PapersTemplate.dotx file in the “Templates” directory of their hard drive. To do so, simply open the AIAA Meeting Papers Template.dotx file and then click 

= Some other headline
All manuscripts are to be submitted electronically to the ScholarOne Abstracts site created for each conference. The manuscript upload will be enabled several weeks after acceptance notices have been sent.  Presenting authors of accepted papers will receive an email with instructions when manuscript submission opens. It is *important* that presenting authors keep their email addresses up-to-date so they do not miss this notice.

= General Guidelines
The following section outlines general (nonformatting) guidelines to follow. These guidelines are applicable to all authors (except as noted), and include information on the policies and practices relevant to the publication of your CHANGED.

== Publication by AIAA
Your manuscript cannot be published by AIAA if:
+	It has been published previously or
+	Changed for something new

== Paper Review and Visa Considerations
It is the responsibility of the author to obtain any required government or company reviews for their papers in advance of publication. Start early to determine if the reviews are required; this process can take several weeks.

If you plan to attend an AIAA Forum, technical conference or professional development course held in the United States and you require a visa for travel, it is incumbent upon you to apply for a visa with the U.S. embassy (consular division) or consulate with ample time for processing. 

== Control ID Number vs Paper 
Your paper was assigned a control ID number at the time you submitted your abstract. It is critical that you reference the tracking number and conference name when contacting AIAA regarding your submission. The control ID number is not the final AIAA paper number. The paper number, which appears in the format AIAA-20XX-XXXX, will be used to refer to your paper in the program and in any publication format. It will not be assigned until shortly before the conference.  *Do not include a paper number anywhere on your paper, as this number will be stamped automatically in the top right corner of your paper at the time of processing.*
