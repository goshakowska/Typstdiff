#emph[fluid dynamics] in #strike[glaciers];#underline[changed] ha they
contribute to the formation and behaviour of these
#strike[natural];#underline[changed] structures.

All manuscripts are to be #strike[submitted];#underline[changed]
electronically to the ScholarOne Abstracts site created for each
conference. The manuscript upload will be enabled several weeks after
acceptance notices have been sent. Presenting authors of accepted papers
will receive an email with instructions when manuscript submission
opens. It is important that presenting authors keep their email
addresses up-to-date so they do not miss this notice.

It is the responsibility of the #strike[author];#underline[changed] to
obtain any required government or company reviews for their papers in
advance of publication. Start early to determine if the reviews are
required; this process can take several weeks.
